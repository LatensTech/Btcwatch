# **BTCwatch â€” Potentia Drop**  
*Signal without noise.*  

---

## **Why This Exists**  
Most crypto price trackers want you to:  
- Sign up for an account  
- Sit through ads  
- Give away your data to some cloud service  

We think thatâ€™s dumb.  
You donâ€™t need Wall Streetâ€™s permission to know the price of Bitcoin.  

BTCwatch is your **personal stealth node** â€” it logs Bitcoin prices **hourly**, **locally**, and **privately**.  
No cloud. No backend. No gatekeepers.  

---

## **What It Does**  
Every hour (auto-cron) BTCwatch will:  
- ðŸ“¡ **Fetch live Bitcoin price** from CoinGecko  
- ðŸ“² **Send a notification** to your phone  
- ðŸ“¬ **Send a Telegram alert** (optional â€” if you configure it)  
- ðŸ—‚ **Log every update** to your private Potentia intel vault  

You own the data. Always.  

---

## **Why It Matters**  
- **No middleman:** All runs on your device â€” not someone elseâ€™s server.  
- **Offline-proof:** Logs remain even if you lose internet.  
- **Modular:** Built on the Potentia Protocol â€” can live alongside other drops without conflict.
